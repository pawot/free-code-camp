                    <p>Karel Čapek was a great Czech writer renowned for his science fiction works. The word
                        <strong>Robot</strong>, invented by his brother Josef, was first used in Čapek's drama
                        <cite>R.U.R</cite>. In his books and plays, Karel Čapek reflected contemporary society issues
                        and dealt with inner life of human. He actively opposed fascism as well as communism.
