            <header>What is HTML?</header>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web
                pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML
                consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content
                to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to
                connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:
            </p>
            <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
            <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a
                paragraph (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) element:</p>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;p&gt;</code>
        </section>
        <section id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element" class="main-section">
            <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
            <p>Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:</p>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-small.png"
                alt="paragraph tag example picture">
            <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p
                        for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the
                        element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph
                        text.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the
                        paragraph text.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a
                        forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a
                        closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>

            <header>Nesting elements</header>
            <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat
                is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element, which means that
                the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:</p>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;p&gt;</code>
            <p>The tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Block_versus_inline_elements" class="main-section">
            <header>Block versus inline elements</header>
            <p>There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline elements.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line
                        following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also
                        appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For
                        example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or
                        footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be
                        nested inside another block-level element.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the
                        document's content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not
                        cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an
                        <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
                        or <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> create emphasis.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="Empty_elements" class="main-section">
            <header>Empty elements</header>
            <p>Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist
                of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. For example, the
                <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element embeds an image file onto a page.

        </section>
        <section id="Attributes" class="main-section">
            <header>Attributes</header>
            <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
                alt="Attribute example image">
            <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example,
                the <code>class</code> attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style
                information.</p>
            <p>An attribute should have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the
                        attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section id="What_is_CSS?" class="main-section">
            <header>What is CSS?</header>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the
                hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms
                about the language.</p>
            <p>In the Introduction to HTML module we covered what HTML is, and how it is used to mark up documents.
                These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text,
                paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to
                distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing is the browser's default styles — very
                basic styles that the browser applies to HTML to make sure it will be basically readable even if no
                explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.</p>
            <p>However, the web would be a boring place if all websites looked like that. Using CSS you can control
                exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="What_is_CSS_for?" class="main-section">
            <header>What is CSS for?</header>
            <p>As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how
                they are styled, laid out, etc.</p>
            <p>A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup
                language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p>
            <p>Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like
                Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer
                screen, projector or printer.</p>
            <p>CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of
                headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a
                layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects
                such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="CSS_syntax" class="main-section">
            <header>CSS syntax</header>
            <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to
                particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my
                page to be shown as large red text."</p>
            <p>The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
    h1 {
        color: red;
        font-size: 5em;
    }</code>
            </pre>
            <p>The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case
                we are styling level one headings (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>).</p>
            <p>We then have a set of curly braces <code>&lt;{ }&gt;</code>. Inside those will be one or more
                declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the
                element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.</p>
            <p>Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different
                allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color
                property, which can take various color values. We also have the <code>font-size</code> property. This
                property can
                take various size units as a value.</p>
            <p>A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
    h1 {
        color: red;
        font-size: 5em;
    }
            
    p {
        color: black;
    }</code>
            </pre>
            <p>You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you will need to look up. The individual
                property pages on MDN give you a quick way to look up properties and their values when you forget, or
                want to know what else you can use as a value.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="CSS_Modules" class="main-section">
            <header>CSS Modules</header>
            <p>As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules.
                You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN and many of the documentation pages are
                organized around a particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the
                Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is, and what different properties and other
                features it contains. You will also find links to the CSS Specification that defines the technology (see
                below).</p>
            <p>At this stage you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured, however it can make it easier
                to find information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to be found among
                other similar things and are therefore probably in the same specification.</p>
            <p>For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module — you might think that it
                makes logical sense for the <code>background-color</code> and <code>border-color</code> properties to be
                defined in this module. And you'd be right.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="CSS_Specifications" class="main-section">
            <header>CSS Specifications</header>
            <p>All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called
                specifications (or "specs"), which are published by standards organizations (such as the W3C, WHATWG,
                ECMA, or Khronos) and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.</p>
            <p>CSS is no different — it is developed by a group within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. This group
                is made of representatives of browser vendors and other companies who have an interest in CSS. There are
                also other people, known as invited experts, who act as independent voices; they are not linked to a
                member organization.</p>
            <p>New CSS features are developed, or specified, by the CSS Working Group. Sometimes because a particular
                browser is interested in having some capability, other times because web designers and developers are
                asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group itself has identified a requirement. CSS
                is constantly developing, with new features becoming available. However, a key thing about CSS is that
                everyone works very hard to never change things in a way that would break old websites. A website built
                in 2000, using the limited CSS available then, should still be usable in a browser today!</p>
            <p>As a newcomer to CSS, it is likely that you will find the CSS specs overwhelming — they are intended for
                engineers to use to implement support for the features in user agents, not for web developers to read to
                understand CSS. Many experienced developers would much rather refer to MDN documentation or other
                tutorials. It is however worth knowing that they exist, understanding the relationship between the CSS
                you are using, browser support (see below), and the specs.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Browser_support_information" class="main-section">
            <header>Browser support information</header>
            <p>Once CSS has been specified then it is only useful for us in developing web pages if one or more browsers
                have implemented it. This means that the code has been written to turn the instruction in our CSS file
                into something that can be output to the screen. We'll look at this process more in the lesson How CSS
                works. It is unusual for all browsers to implement a feature at the same time, and so there is usually a
                gap where you can use some part of CSS in some browsers and not in others. For this reason, being able
                to check implementation status is useful.</p>
